# WK5_ATM 
An ATM system in C that allows multiple predefined users to log in and perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing, withdrawing, and viewing transaction history. The system simulates a real ATM interface and demonstrates how arrays and strings can be used to manage user accounts and operations.

*System Overview*

The user logs in by entering a username and a 4-digit PIN.

After a successful login, the user can:

- Check balance

- Deposit money

- Withdraw money

- View basic transaction log (text-based summary)

- Log out

*How to run the system*

Clone the repository onto your machine, then compile atm.c and link it with functions.c and login.c, then run the executable.

There are three predefined users with their respective 4-digit login pins: 
1. 'aman' - 1234
2. 'joseph' - 5678
3. 'thadee' - 9012

Log in with any of the usernames and their respective 4-digit pin.
